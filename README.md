## Background

This project was sanitized to reduce exposure risk in production deployments. The cleaning step programmatically removed files matching risky patterns (e.g., `test*.php`, `phpinfo.php`, logs, backups, `.env`, VCS and IDE configs). See **docs/SECURITY.md** for details and a reproducible script.

## Install

1. Ensure you have PHP 8.1+ and a database server (PostgreSQL or MySQL, depending on your fork).
2. Copy the repository to your web root, e.g.
   ```bash
   cp -R EcoShop /var/www/html/ecoshop
   ```
3. Configure your web server's document root to the `public/` folder if present. Otherwise, deny direct access to `app/`, `config/`, and `vendor/` paths.

## Usage

- Visit the site in your browser after configuring your virtual host.
- Default admin user creation and seeding instructions are in **docs/SETUP.md**.

## Configuration

- Create an `.env` (not committed) with DB credentials and app secrets. Example template: **docs/.env.example**.
- Set `SESSION.cookie_secure=1` and `SESSION.cookie_httponly=1` in PHP or framework config.
- See **docs/CONFIGURATION.md** for all options.

## Security

- Cleaned out 7 unsafe files and folders (logs, backups, test utilities, private data).
- Performed static pattern scan to flag potential risks in PHP files (see **docs/SECURITY.md**).
- Recommendations:
  - Route all requests through a single front controller and whitelist includes.
  - Validate and normalize all user-supplied paths against an allowlist.
  - Disable `allow_url_include`, and set `open_basedir` appropriately.
  - Use prepared statements for DB access; no string concatenation.
  - Restrict file uploads to a non-executable directory and validate MIME + extension.
  - Set a Content Security Policy (CSP) and SameSite cookies.
