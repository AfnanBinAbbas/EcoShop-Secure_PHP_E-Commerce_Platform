# Security Fixes Applied to EcoShop E-commerce Project

## Overview
This document outlines the security vulnerabilities that were identified and fixed in the EcoShop e-commerce project, along with the implementation of functional cookie management for session and order handling.

## Vulnerabilities Fixed

### 1. Directory Traversal Vulnerability Prevention
**Status**: ✅ **SECURED**

**Issue**: The project was analyzed for potential directory traversal vulnerabilities where attackers could access files outside the intended directory structure.

**Solution**: 
- Enhanced input validation and sanitization in `api/config.php`
- Implemented proper path validation to prevent `../` attacks
- Added security headers to prevent various attack vectors
- Strengthened file access controls

**Files Modified**:
- `api/config.php` - Enhanced security settings and input validation

### 2. Session Security Hardening
**Status**: ✅ **SECURED**

**Improvements Made**:
- Set `session.cookie_secure` to `1` for HTTPS environments
- Enabled `session.cookie_httponly` to prevent XSS attacks
- Configured `session.use_strict_mode` for enhanced security
- Set `session.cookie_samesite` to 'Lax' for CSRF protection
- Implemented proper session timeout (1 hour)

## Cookie Management Implementation

### 1. Functional cookies.txt and order_cookies.txt
**Status**: ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**

**New Features**:
- **Session Cookie Management**: Automatically saves and retrieves session cookies in `cookies.txt`
- **Order Cookie Management**: Saves order-specific session cookies in `order_cookies.txt`
- **Cookie Persistence**: Maintains user sessions across requests
- **Secure Storage**: Cookie files have proper permissions (0600)

### 2. New Files Created

#### `api/cookie_manager.php`
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive cookie management system
- **Features**:
  - Save/retrieve session cookies
  - Save/retrieve order cookies
  - Clean expired cookies
  - Secure file permissions
  - Netscape cookie format support

#### `api/session_restore.php`
- **Purpose**: Session restoration from cookie files
- **Features**:
  - Restore sessions from cookies.txt or order_cookies.txt
  - Session validation and integrity checks
  - IP address validation
  - Session timeout handling
  - User account verification

#### `test_cookie_functionality.php`
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive testing of cookie functionality
- **Tests**:
  - Cookie manager initialization
  - Session cookie save/retrieve
  - Order cookie save/retrieve
  - File existence and format validation
  - Permission verification
  - Cookie cleanup functionality

### 3. Integration Points

#### Authentication System (`api/auth.php`)
- **Login**: Automatically saves session cookie to `cookies.txt`
- **Registration**: Saves session cookie for new users
- **Logout**: Clears session cookie from `cookies.txt`

#### Order System (`api/orders.php`)
- **Order Creation**: Saves order-specific cookie to `order_cookies.txt`
- **Order Tracking**: Uses order cookies for session management

## Security Enhancements

### 1. Input Validation
- Enhanced `sanitizeInput()` function with proper escaping
- Strengthened email validation with disposable domain checks
- Improved password strength requirements
- Added CSRF token generation and verification

### 2. Rate Limiting
- Implemented rate limiting for login attempts (5 attempts per 15 minutes)
- Registration rate limiting (3 attempts per hour)
- File-based rate limiting with automatic cleanup

### 3. Security Logging
- Comprehensive security event logging in `logs/security.log`
- IP address tracking for all security events
- Failed login attempt monitoring
- Session restoration tracking

### 4. Database Security
- Prepared statements to prevent SQL injection
- Connection timeout settings
- Proper error handling without information disclosure

## File Permissions and Security

### Cookie Files
- `cookies.txt`: 0600 (read/write for owner only)
- `order_cookies.txt`: 0600 (read/write for owner only)

### Log Files
- `logs/security.log`: Secure logging with proper permissions
- `logs/php_errors.log`: Error logging without sensitive data exposure

## Testing Results

All cookie functionality tests pass successfully:
- ✅ Cookie manager initialization
- ✅ Session cookie save/retrieve operations
- ✅ Order cookie save/retrieve operations
- ✅ File format validation
- ✅ Permission verification (0600)
- ✅ Cookie cleanup functionality
- ✅ Expired cookie removal

## Usage Instructions

### For Developers

1. **Session Management**:
   ```php
   // Save session cookie
   saveSessionCookie(session_id());
   
   // Retrieve session cookie
   $sessionId = getSessionCookie();
   
   // Clear session cookie
   clearSessionCookie();
   ```

2. **Order Management**:
   ```php
   // Save order cookie
   saveOrderCookie(session_id());
   
   // Retrieve order cookie
   $orderSessionId = getOrderCookie();
   
   // Clear order cookie
   clearOrderCookie();
   ```

3. **Session Restoration**:
   ```javascript
   // Restore session from cookies
   fetch('/api/session_restore.php', {
       method: 'POST',
       headers: {'Content-Type': 'application/json'},
       body: JSON.stringify({type: 'session'}) // or 'order'
   });
   ```

### For System Administrators

1. **Monitor Security Logs**:
   ```bash
   tail -f logs/security.log
   ```

2. **Check Cookie Files**:
   ```bash
   ls -la cookies.txt order_cookies.txt
   ```

3. **Test Cookie Functionality**:
   ```bash
   php test_cookie_functionality.php
   ```

## Security Recommendations

1. **Production Deployment**:
   - Ensure HTTPS is enabled for secure cookie transmission
   - Set `session.cookie_secure` to `1` in production
   - Regularly monitor security logs
   - Implement log rotation for security and error logs

2. **Maintenance**:
   - Regularly clean expired cookies using the built-in cleanup functionality
   - Monitor file permissions on cookie files
   - Review security logs for suspicious activity

3. **Backup**:
   - Include cookie files in backup procedures if session persistence is required
   - Ensure proper restoration procedures for cookie files

## Conclusion

The EcoShop e-commerce project has been successfully secured against directory traversal vulnerabilities and enhanced with a comprehensive cookie management system. The implementation provides:

- **Security**: Protection against common web vulnerabilities
- **Functionality**: Robust session and order cookie management
- **Reliability**: Comprehensive testing and validation
- **Maintainability**: Clear documentation and logging

All security fixes have been tested and verified to work correctly while maintaining the application's functionality.
